## ðŸ¤” What is this?

> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a transformative technology that enables developers to build applications previously unattainable. However, using LLMs in isolation is often insufficient to create a truly powerful application. The real power comes from combining them with other sources of computation or knowledge - the exploration of their integration with robotics is just beginning.
