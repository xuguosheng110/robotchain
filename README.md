## 🤔 What is this?

> Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a transformative technology that enables developers to build applications previously unattainable. However, using LLMs in isolation is often insufficient to create a truly powerful application. The real power comes from combining them with other sources of computation or knowledge - the exploration of their integration with robotics is just beginning.

- The inspiration for this project comes from [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

- RobotChain is developed and built based on GoLang, Vue+Vite+Typescript, Python, and ROS2.
